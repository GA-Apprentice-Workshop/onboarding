Week 1:
======
Touch base with them daily, at least.  If you don’t hear from them, check in-- better to do that early and get them unstuck then leave them. Overall first week goals:
* Introduction to the company (policy, departments, goals, etc)
* Introduction to the team (roles, rules, current projects, etc)
* Introduction to team workflow (git, issue tracker, task manager, etc)
* Set up individualized expectations for them. They must know what is expected, even though they will start with tiny, peripheral tasks.

### Day 1 and 2
* Environment setup: Buddy up with last person to get dev env up and running. Make it clear it’s totally OK to ask all kinds of questions.
* Documentation: New engineer updates dev environment documentation if it’s out of date or confusing.(They feel like they’re contributing, and your documentation is better as a result!)
* Work prep: Any technical tools or frameworks they need to know but don’t, yet, hand them the right books/material to get them started.  (Technical Material)

### Day 3-5
* Study Journal: Get them started on blogging/journaling-for themselves and for you: 3 things per week that they didn’t understand, three new things they’ve learned, etc. It can be a simple list with minor descriptions or a full on blog -- up to you. You can take a look at it together, or have them email it to you, so you’re aware of what they’re thinking about.
* Troubleshooting Log: It’s helpful for a new developer to keep a “Things I’ve learned” file somewhere, for reference later- this can keep information such as what directory one should be in when running certain sporadically-used commands, and to remind them later of details they may forget.
* App architecture "class": Set-up a briefing to walk them through the architecture of the stack. Key technologies, practices and the relevance of it to their particular role should be communicated.
* Design patterns: Patterns commonly used throughout our apps, best practices, resource material to reference for later.
* First PR: Ideally have them ship something small to learn the process for shipping and releasing code.
* Onboarding social event!!!


Week 2 
======
* Continue updating documentation on a new app.
* Q&A session: Set up a 10-15 min session to give junior an opportunity to ask questions that might be circling their heads. This can serve as a checkpoint for how well they're on-boarding and setup the next steps.
* App architecture: (see above)
* Design patterns: (see above)
* First project: Applying what they're learning about team process daily is one of the most important things they can do. Introduce a small, _well scoped_ project that is not time-sensitive for product, that shouldn’t be too technically complex, but gives them an opportunity to start learning the code style of your company. 
* Pair programming: Give them an opportunity to see how others work and learn from it. Ask them about the code being worked on to guage their knowledge, teach process, and engage their ideas about problem solving. (30-60 min)
* First feedback: It's been two weeks! How's it going?

Week 3:
======
* Goal setting: It's time to add them to current tasking and projects. Start setting some goals, for what you think they can achieve, and what they WANT to achieve, in a month, in 3 months, 6 months, a year.  It helps to ask them what their goals are, first. 
* Lessons Learned presentations: Have junior engineers give a 5 or 10 minute presentation on a small topic either biweekly or monthly (i.e. generators, decorators, Django ORM layer); this should be something you think they should go off and research independently, that will be useful to them in the long run.
* Feedback sessions: Junior should meet with mentor/supervisor/teammates to get feedback. This is crucial to giving them well-rounded perspective on their role, team expectations, and aligning their work with team goals.


Week 4:
======
* Have them go back to things they learned in the last month, and explain a concept from start to finish.  Maybe it was something you went over in code lab 3 weeks ago; see what has stuck in their brain, and where you can fill in gaps that have been overlooked.  It shouldn’t feel like a test, but rather a chance to say, in their own words, what they’ve learned.  It can be 5 minutes of time during code lab or a one-on-one, but it’s useful to revisit the things you learned in context of all the stuff you’ve done in the intervening time.
* Continue to check in regularly; perhaps still daily, just to say “How’s it going?  How are you feeling about everything?  Anything you need a hand with?” It may seem obvious to you that they can ask for help, but you’d be surprised what a difference actually voicing this can make.
* At some point, you can discontinue the shadowing or at least bring it down to once a week, or have it be an elective on the jr engineer’s part.  Can taper off the “3 things I’ve learned/ 3 things I didn’t get”; you can check in with your eng and see how helpful these are to them. 
* Once they’ve done a small project on their own, maybe they’d like to pair with a more sr member of the team on a project, where they take turns driving. 

Beyond:
======
* Touch base regularly on their goals, whether there are any roadblocks to achieving them, etc.
* This is all an organic process, intended to get them up and running and confident as quickly as possible; if something’s not working for either of you, feel free to discontinue, or modify it to fit your needs. Especially after the first month, a lot of on-boarding ends up being specific to your company, your needs for this person, their interests; the tools we’ve listed are a good starting point, but you’ll need to tailor your onboarding in months 2+ for yourself, your new engineer, and your company.
